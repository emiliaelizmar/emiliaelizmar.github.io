            Hello! My name is Emilia Marcus and I am a student at the University of South Carolina majoring in Sociology. My main goal is to keep the technological landscape as ethical and morally sound as possible. It is important to me that our resources are used in ways that are people-forward!

                This diagram presents many of the steps and initial processes that need to occur in order to create a high-level and helpful Artificial Intelligence model that is ethical at a base level. It covers the initial stages of building said model such as funding needs, testing periods, and data gathering. It also expands on the underlying issue of the ethical dilemma that surrrounds AI as well as the tangible, negative affects that AI can have if not used properly.

        These are concept sketches for a mobile Artificial Intelligence app called "ClearMind". These sketches show the very base level idea that it functions as a chatbot that can answer questions, chat with you, and has a focus on making the world a better place using education and entertainment.
