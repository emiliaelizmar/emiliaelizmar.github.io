                This diagram presents many of the steps and initial processes that need to occur in order to create a high-level and helpful Artificial Intelligence model that is ethical at a base level. It covers the initial stages of building said model such as funding needs, testing periods, and data gathering. It also expands on the underlying issue of the ethical dilemma that surrrounds AI as well as the tangible, negative affects that AI can have if not used properly.
